1. What was the bug?
   the bug is num1 and num2 are string type that is why javascript concat num1 and num2 with plus sign.
2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use)1.
   i would fix by casting num1 and num2 to integers to fix the problem  with the following line  let result = parseInt(num1)+ parseInt(num2)
